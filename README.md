# Hybrid-Automation
Azure Voice assistant Project
Description: -
Automation voice assistant simply takes command through our voice and return the output to us. think we have to launch a compute instance at region East US without giving command from keyboard we will simply give the voice command to the voice assistant and the voice command should be like Hey Assistant Can you launch a compute instance at the region East US 2, Just by speaking this command, our voice assistant will launch a compute instance for us. well this is only an example we will implement all the Azure services including AI and Machine Learning, Serverless, Kubernetes, Compute, Containers: AKS and featured service also because azure have all the command available in the Azure CLI library we will Dynamically Add this CLI command in Python Voice Assistant program I have attached an example Screenshots attachment, In this SS, I have shown how this work
